Demo for tutorials that help you create a new Next.js app that can dynamically pull in character information and add animations with Framer.js.

Learn how to create your own with [How to Create a Dynamic Rick and Morty Wiki Web App with Next.js](https://github.com/TravelXML/RICK-AND-MORTY-API-NEXT)

## Implementation

1. GET any 2 characters from the Rick and Morty API that interest you using the 'character'
API that are
* Male AND Alive OR

## Endpoints

### `http://localhost:3000/` - Male AND Alive OR / default
### `http://localhost:3000/female` - Female AND Dead
### `http://localhost:3000/locations` - locations that are of type planet
### `http://localhost:3000/character/{id}` - Individual Character Details
